## General

*  [**Agile- Just the Basics**](<https://www.alexandercowan.com/agile-just-basics/>). This page coversâ€¦the basics. It's a good place to start if you want to understand the general nature of a topic and how it relates to the practice of agile.

* [**Your Best Agile User Story**](<https://www.alexandercowan.com/best-agile-user-story/>). This page covers the user story- how to prepare to write them, how to use them, and how to link them to implementation and testing. Read this during week 4 especially.



## Venture_Design

* [**Venture Design** ](<https://www.alexandercowan.com/venture-design/>).This page provides a comprehensive set of resources. What I would do for a general overview is just read the intro to each of the areas (Personas, Problem Scenarios, etc.). You can also access a template, for use with any project, at [**this link**](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M7UGO-XymKBNfFvqIjeWdABO7z1f4JOaje_VjCOi4ss/edit>).



## Design_Thinking

* [**Personas**](<https://www.alexandercowan.com/tutorial-personas-problem-scenarios-user-stories/>). This page introduces the use of personas and problem scenarios, the primary design thinking tools we use here in the specialization. Take this tutorial during Week 3.

* [**Customer Discovery (Persona and Problem Hypothesis)**](<https://www.alexandercowan.com/customer-discovery-handbook/#Persona_Problem_Hypothesis>). This section of the handbook steps through methods for talking to users, customers and generally doing design research. Read this handbook during week 3.



## Tools

* [**The Enterprise Software Playbook**](<https://www.alexandercowan.com/enterprise-software-playbook/>). This page introduces the use of product design and lean concepts for use in enterprise software.
