* Question + Data = Story

* Thinking in the context of Data Visualization, define an example, from your own expertise, experience, or interest of the Who, What, and How of an issue you would like to solve. Do not exceed one-page in explaining your issue. <br/>
Be sure your reviewers are able to clearly identify your Who, What, and How of the issue.

Currently the strategic team using Excel sheet to compile the revenue, cost and some detail business data from each team. However, using Excel sheet is not effective and scalable compared with using coding methods. Therefore, our team takes over this project and plan to use more systematic ways to organise those data and present it through dashboards. 
The purpose of this project is to let not only management level but also all internal employees easily track the business metric real-time through dashboard which is not possible if you use the Excel sheet. As for the information of what should demonstrate, different level of people might expect differently. For instance, ExCo (Executive, CEO, COO, CTO, etc) might only want to see big picture of what's going on in our company such as total revenue, total cost, month over month growth, etc. Those people might not want to see detail business metrics. For manager level, they might need to see detail business metric to tackle with the issues that are facing in our business. Because of this, when we are building the data warehouse and creating the dashboards, we need to consider carefully what sort of information that we need to include and to what extent. The dashboards are really important to all the company since it will show the performance and some detail insights of what's happening of this company and let the management level to make better strategic decisions.


The dashboards are mainly for management level and internal employees to track the performance(revenue, cost and business metrics) of our company. Since different users require different kind of data, need to make sure the data we present are for specific target of audience. (ex: CEO only need summary data while managers may need more detail data of specific business metric)
