* Question 1: Describe how the three functional roles of marketing analytics (data strategist, techie, and data designer) are filled in your current organization or an organization of your choice. <br/>

I work at a fintech startup and we have those roles in our company but we called them differently. For data strategist, I would rather say a marketing analyst. Those people will monitor business metrics (ex: web sessions, pageviews, conversation rate, CPA, CPC, etc) daily and then do A/B testings to make better marketing strategies to reduce cost but at the same time attract new customers and maintain existing customers. For techie, I would call it a data engineer. For them, their main job responsibility is to help us ensure we can get the information of what customers do while visiting our websites, or gathering customers' touching point. Besides, their role also includes building a stable infrastructure that can store all the customer information. For data designer, I will call it business intelligence. Their role is more on deciding what sort of information are useful for our company and how to leverage all this information to turn data into opportunities and make those data accessible for all internal users. 


* Question 2: Explain why you think "pain" is a necessary element in any good web analysis project. <br/>

Quality analysis demands a quality approach. To get correct and useful insights, you must need to do a lot of work beforehand. For example, you need to ensure the data that you use for analysis is processing correctly; otherwise, it's just like a famous quote "Garbage in, Garbage out". You feed the model with incorrect data then you definitely will not get correct results. Besides ensuring the data quality, you must understand the domain knowledge of the data that you are analysing. If you do not understand the context fully, then the interpretation will be totally misleading, says misinterpretation. Also, data visualisation is also very important when you want to convey your idea to others. So, understanding the best practices of building the dashboards and creating the graph is also important.
